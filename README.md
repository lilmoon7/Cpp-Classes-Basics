# C++ OOP Basics

This repository contains introductory examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.

Covered topics:
- Defining classes and objects
- Constructors and destructors
- Encapsulation (private attributes with getters and setters)
- Member functions
- Basic interaction with class instances

These examples were developed during my university coursework and personal practice.
